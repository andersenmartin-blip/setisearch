# SETIsearch — current project status

Updated 12 September 2026. This is the maintained operational entry point.
Earlier reports and continuation files preserve their historical states.

## LS7 TESS pilot completed: not qualified

The owner requested a return to optical light-sail work with TESS. The prospective
L 98-59 sector 28 pilot retrieved and checked the public 20-second light curve
and target pixels, dated 31 July–25 August 2020. Eight implementation tests pass.

The frozen quality mask fragments 20.306 accepted cadence-days into 3,779 runs.
Only 2.39 hours survive the screening guards, and no run supports the required
401-sample injection context. **Zero of the 300 planned digital trials ran.**
The method is not qualified; there is no sensitivity estimate or LS candidate.
[Full result and preserved failure](results_ls7_tess/REPORT.md).

A separate time/quality metadata comparison finds 17.527 potentially searchable
cadence-days when correction flags 64 and 1024 are allowed. That alternative
has not been used for a flux search or recovery measurement. Next: freeze explicit
flag handling and an eligibility preflight, then evaluate on an unopened sector.
All other TESS sectors remain unopened. The earlier radio LS results remain intact.

## M43AI native evaluation completed

The fixed combined rule failed the predeclared same-sequence native challenge. It recovered 53/64 signal cases and lost 0/53 signals required by the reference union. 1/48 controls and 0/128 native null cases had surviving members.

[Complete result](MILESTONE_43AI_NATIVE_VALIDATION_RESULT.md). All 240 sealed records passed the final integrity and accounting audit. The exact protocol and model were public before scoring. No threshold was retuned. The original held-out panels remain unopened; the model is not adopted.

The complete result archive, audit and report accompany this science release.
The owner explicitly approved publication of the prepared M43AI package and
main README update after the earlier automatic-review rejection.
[Restore the 240 original records](results_m43ai_native_archive/README.md).

## Previous closed comparison: M43AH completed

[The M43AH epoch-support study](MILESTONE_43AH_EPOCH_SUPPORT_RESULT.md) compared
two fixed observable rule families on the 241 public closed M43AF training
records. Neither meets the joint training requirements; no rule is adopted.

| Conditional family | Fewest required signal losses with zero non-signal leaks | Fewest leaking controls while recovering all 57 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Original coordinates, exact M43AG family | 1 of 57 | 8 of 48 |
| M43AH raw second-epoch ON support | 3 of 57 | 4 of 48 |
| M43AH second-epoch ON-minus-OFF support | 6 of 57 | 12 of 48 |

M43AH exhausts 1,743 and 1,758 ON-cut equivalence classes, respectively.
A separate scalar path verifies 3,497 member features through 14,744 original
profile-center references. The fixed M43AG auditor verifies both complete
sweeps and their extrema/certificates; every zero-leak optimum has complete
case-level recovery and per-reference loss accounting. All 16 new tests pass.

The protocol, code, tests and source preflight were
[published and verified before extraction](https://github.com/andersenmartin-blip/setisearch/commit/3e6a0b60f65d9599ddc78d0aa9ec2e976d5b323f).
All 244 original training-archive files and the unchanged M43AG dependencies
were hash checked. This is retrospective development, not fresh validation.

## Scientific and publication state

| Item | Current state |
|---|---|
| M43AI | Complete native challenge failed; all 240 records, audit and report released |
| M43AH | Completed with full feature/family ledgers, audits, source identities and output hashes |
| M43AG | Completed exact original-boundary obstruction; [result](MILESTONE_43AG_BOUNDARY_OBSTRUCTION_RESULT.md) |
| M43AF training | Published: 241 records, failed joint qualification; [result](MILESTONE_43AF_TRAINING_RESULT.md) |
| M43AF complete no-model study | Saved and audited: 502 records; complete historical archive still awaits publication |
| Adopted new detector / new M43AF–M43AI astronomical candidate | None |
| Earlier M33 HD 3651 case | Still unresolved; [investigation](MILESTONE_33_CANDIDATE_INVESTIGATION.md) |
| LS research | [LS7 TESS pilot](results_ls7_tess/REPORT.md) closed, not qualified; correction-aware policy is the next step; [earlier LS6A](LS6A_SCAN_END_RESULT.md) preserved |

M43AF's 502 records include 261 already completed historical acquisitions and
the 241 training/baseline/null records. Its 940 scientific pins and earlier
endpoints remain unchanged. M43AH performs new downstream feature/rule
calculations, with no full upstream native-pipeline rerun, new telescope data
or additional observing sequence. Control-case counts are not independent
noise realizations; empty native-null/baseline retained sets supply no
conditional tail observations or physical false-alarm probability.

Current science is on m43-support-qualification; main remains a concise overview
with earlier pipeline code. [PROJECT_DIRECTION.md](PROJECT_DIRECTION.md) retains
the owner's long-term direction and ongoing publication authorization.

## Separate pending M43AF complete release

The intact saved package is `setisearch_M43AF_complete_release.zip`, SHA256
`82e649f8aa0faffe88d4020cda4eb5fce4cbdcda1a84015cd48774a94f673999`.
Its 69 parts restore 508 original files, including all 502 records.
Archive SHA256:
`b66e2a2dbe41d3dda4a63254c4528185e761aae7fdcf4745ef8e3764ca6c9443`.

Earlier automatic review rejected this complete-archive upload; that issue
remains unresolved. M43AG and M43AH use only already public training evidence
and did not upload or depend on that blocked historical archive. The prior
20-blob transfer ledger is a resume aid, not proof of a published full release.

When that review restriction is resolved, recheck current refs and missing
payloads, preserve all newer work, and verify the complete destination tree.
Keep the original ZIP and scientific manifests unchanged. If publishing their
exact historical payload at a dedicated release commit, retain/reapply current
operational documentation separately. Do not overwrite this status or the
short README with the old package versions. Compare each manifest against its
exact release commit and verify complete membership and byte identities.

[Restoration notes](M43AF_CURRENT_CONTINUATION.md) distinguish the public training
archive from the pending complete archive. Exact restoration uses recorded
Python 3.12.14 / zlib 1.3.2 and frozen dependencies.

M43AI is complete. Do not rerun or retune this closed study. Any successor
requires a separately fixed protocol and new evaluation evidence. The original
held-out panels remain reserved. Main CI alone does not establish coverage of
the science branch; use the native study audit and original-byte archive checks.
